<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A decent, pre-sliced loaf of bread</li>
    <li>Jelly, preferably grape or strawberry</li>
    <li>Crunchy or extra crunch peanut butter</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Separate bread and lay it face down (this is important) on a flat surface.</li>
    <li>Open the vessels containing the peanut butter and fruit spreads.</li>
    <li>Using a knife, scoop out the peanut butter and jelly <em>FROM ONE SIDE.</em>  This preserves the smoothness of the top of both spreads.</li>
    <li>Inform any within earshot that you have done this with a purpose, and that any who undo your work will suffer.</li>
    <li>Brandish your knife menacingly.</li>
    <l1>I think you were supposed to smear the stuff on the bread before doing that.  Sorry.  I just get so mad when people ruin the smooth top of peanut butter.</l1>
    <li>I guess you should clean up your kitchen and apologize to your friends and family.</li>
    <li>Just eat the sandwich.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this out.</li>
</ol>
